# Airbnb Dashboard in Tableau

## Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb data to gain insights into listings, pricing, availability, and reviews using an interactive **Tableau dashboard**. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and provides detailed information about Airbnb properties, hosts, and guest reviews across different cities.

The Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of the data, allowing users to explore various metrics such as pricing trends, host performance, property types, and geographical distribution.
